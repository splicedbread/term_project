ToDo:
	Big:
		Add openGL support, incorporating sprites
		Add a linear generated micro dungeon for the players to navigate
		Add a small lineup of items and gear that mildly changes stats
			- doesnt need to be in-depth right now
		Add a variety of simple enemies
		Add the *required* turn-based combat interaction
	Small:
		Working on it Add documentation to character.h and character.cpp
		Not yet Add in #include <filesystem> for creating initial file directory
		Sorta Add a GameState class that handles the reading/writing of character data to a .bin file
